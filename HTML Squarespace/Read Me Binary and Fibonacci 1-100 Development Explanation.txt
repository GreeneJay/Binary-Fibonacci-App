Design Components
Binary and Fibonacci Learning App - Code Component Explanation

This document provides an overview of the main components in the Godot project for developers who might want to understand, modify, or extend the application.

 Main Components

 1. Main.gd
- **Purpose**: Acts as the central controller for the application.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `start_game()`: Transitions from title screen to game screen.
  - `exit_game()`: Quits the application.
  - `back_to_title()`: Returns to the title screen from the game screen.

 2. TitleScreen.gd
- **Purpose**: Manages the title screen UI and interactions.
- **Key Elements**:
  - `StartButton`: Initiates the game.
  - `ExitButton`: Closes the application.

3. GameScreen.gd
- **Purpose**: Core gameplay logic and UI management.
- **Key Variables**:
  - `current_number`: The number currently being examined (1-100).
  - `fibonacci_sequence`: Pre-calculated Fibonacci numbers up to 89.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `update_displays()`: Updates all UI elements based on the current number.
  - `get_binary_representation()`: Converts a number to its binary representation.
  - `get_binary_composition()`: Breaks down a number into powers of 2.
  - `get_active_slots()`: Visualizes which binary digits are "active".
  - `get_fibonacci_composition()`: Decomposes a number into Fibonacci numbers.
  - `is_fibonacci()`: Checks if a number is in the Fibonacci sequence.

UI Structure

The UI is primarily composed of two scenes:

1. TitleScreen:
   - VBoxContainer
     - TitleLabel
     - AboutBinaryLabel
     - AboutFibonacciLabel
     - StartButton
     - ExitButton

2. GameScreen:
   - VBoxContainer
     - TitleLabel
     - CurrentNumberLabel
     - HSlider
     - HBoxContainer
       - VBoxContainer (Left)
         - ActiveSlotsLabel
         - BinaryLabel
         - BinaryCompositionLabel
       - VBoxContainer (Right)
         - FibonacciOrNotLabel
         - FibonacciCompositionLabel
     - BackButton

Key Algorithms

1. **Binary Conversion**: Uses bitwise operations to efficiently convert decimal to binary.
2. **Binary Composition**: Decomposes a number into powers of 2 using a greedy algorithm.
3. **Fibonacci Composition**: Uses a greedy algorithm to decompose a number into Fibonacci numbers.

Extensibility

To extend this project, consider:
1. Adding more number systems (e.g., hexadecimal).
2. Implementing interactive visualizations for binary and Fibonacci concepts.
3. Creating additional levels or challenges to test user understanding.
4. Integrating with educational APIs or databases for expanded content.

Performance Considerations

- The Fibonacci sequence is pre-calculated up to 89 to balance between coverage and performance.
- Binary operations use efficient bitwise operations.
- UI updates are batched in the `update_displays()` function to minimize draw calls.

Potential Improvements

1. Implement caching for frequently calculated values.
2. Add localization support for multiple languages.
3. Create a more robust state management system for larger feature sets.
4. Implement unit tests for core mathematical functions.

This project demonstrates effective use of Godot's scene system, GDScript's concise syntax, and fundamental computer science concepts. It serves as both an educational tool for users and a code example for developers interested in educational game development.
